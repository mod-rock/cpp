When a variable is defined, you can also provide an initial value for the variable at the same time. This is called initialization. The value used to initialize a variable is called an initializer.\n\nInitialization in C++ is surprisingly complex, so we’ll present a simplified view here.\n\nThere are 4 basic ways to initialize variables in C++:","metadata":{},"id":"d190ae12-ecdc-444c-a355-88f15ee47833"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"int e;     // no initialiser\nint f = 5; // initialiser after equal sign\nint g(6); // initialiser in parenthesis\nint h{7}; // initialiser in braces","metadata":{},"id":"a2858c45-536e-4e86-b7b7-12692f3b3f4c"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Copy initialization\n\nWhen an initializer is provided after an equals sign, this is called copy initialization.
